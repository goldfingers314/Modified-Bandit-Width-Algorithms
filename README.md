# Modified-Bandit-Width-Algorithms
UCB and variants

This is the multiarmed banditwidth for two "arms" drawn from a uniform distribution (0 to 1) Look at latex file for more details.

We believe that the simmons algorithm has a better error rate than the classic UCB, although to actually verify this one should implement this for more n and larger number of test cases to average over per n, in python, since r is way too slow.
