# Modified-Bandit-Width-Algorithms
UCB and variants

This is the multiarmed banditwidth for two "arms" drawn from a uniform distribution (0 to 1) Look at latex file for more details.

We believe that the simmons algorithm has a better error rate than the classic UCB due to preliminary plots of the error rate against the number of trials, although to actually verify this one should implement this for more numbers of trials and larger number of test cases to average over per n, in python, since r is way too slow.
